   - Current streak (days)
   - Articles read count
   - Activity breakdown by type with percentages
   - Visual progress bars
8. **SOS Button** - Now navigates to `/emergency` (SOS page) instead of Learn page

### Technical Changes:

## Critical Bug Fixes (Latest - October 28, 2025) ✅

All critical bugs have been identified and resolved:

### ✅ Fixed Issues:

1. **AI Chat Navigation** 
   - **Issue**: Quick Access "Health AI" button showed "Coming Soon" message
   - **Fix**: Updated navigation to route to `/ai/chat` (existing AI Chat feature)
   - **Location**: `lib/features/home/screens/home_screen.dart`

2. **Medications Screen**
   - **Status**: ✅ Verified - No issues found
   - **Features Working**: 
     - Add from presets
     - Add custom medication
     - Edit/delete medications
     - Auto-refresh on state changes
     - Elderly-friendly UI

3. **SOS/Emergency Page - Blank Screen Bug** 
   - **Issue**: After adding an emergency contact, the page remained blank and contacts weren't displayed
   - **Root Cause**: The `EmergencyBloc` event handlers (`_onAddEmergencyContact`, `_onUpdateEmergencyContact`, `_onDeleteEmergencyContact`) were not emitting updated states after performing CRUD operations
   - **Fix**: Added state reloading after each operation to emit `EmergencyLoaded` with fresh contact list
   - **Location**: `lib/features/emergency/bloc/emergency_bloc.dart`
   - **Changes**:
     - `_onAddEmergencyContact` now reloads and emits contacts after adding
     - `_onUpdateEmergencyContact` now reloads and emits contacts after updating
     - `_onDeleteEmergencyContact` now reloads and emits contacts after deleting

### Technical Details:

**Before (Broken):**
```dart
Future<void> _onAddEmergencyContact(...) async {
  try {
    await _emergencyService.addEmergencyContact(event.contact);
    // ❌ No state emission - UI stays blank
  } catch (e) {
    emit(EmergencyError(e.toString()));
  }
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```dart
Future<void> _onAddEmergencyContact(...) async {
  try {
    await _emergencyService.addEmergencyContact(event.contact);
    // ✅ Reload contacts and emit new state
    final contacts = await _emergencyService.getEmergencyContacts().first;
    emit(EmergencyLoaded(contacts: contacts));
  } catch (e) {
    emit(EmergencyError(e.toString()));
  }
}
```

The SOS page now properly displays all emergency contacts immediately after adding, updating, or deleting them!

### 4. **Health Permission Errors (Console Logs)**
   - **Issue**: Console showed multiple `FLUTTER_HEALTH::ERROR` messages about missing health permissions (READ_STEPS, READ_HEART_RATE, READ_SLEEP)
   - **Root Cause**: `getHealthMetrics()` was throwing exceptions when permissions weren't granted, causing the app to attempt reads that would fail
   - **Fix**: Updated `getHealthMetrics()` to return default values (0) instead of throwing exceptions when:
     - Health permissions are not granted
     - Any errors occur during data fetching
   - **Additional Fix**: Updated `_storeHealthMetrics()` to handle errors gracefully without rethrowing
   - **Location**: `lib/features/health/services/health_monitoring_service.dart`
   - **Result**: 
     - App continues to function smoothly without health permissions
     - No more error spam in console
     - Users see 0 values for health metrics until they grant permissions
     - Health data storage only happens when valid data is available

### 5. **Medication Button Route Fix**
   - **Issue**: Medication button in app bar showed "No route found" error
   - **Root Cause**: Button was navigating to `/medications` but the actual route is `/health/medications`
   - **Fix**: Updated navigation path from `/medications` to `/health/medications`
   - **Location**: `lib/features/home/screens/home_screen.dart`
   - **Result**: Medication button now works correctly

## Additional Bug Fixes & Improvements (Latest - October 29, 2025) ✅

All requested updates have been completed:

### ✅ Fixed Issues:

1. **SOS Countdown Visual Feedback**
   - **Issue**: The 5-second countdown was not visibly updating on the UI
   - **Root Cause**: The countdown was set to 5 initially and waited 5 seconds without updating the UI each second
   - **Fix**: Modified `_onTriggerSOS` in EmergencyBloc to emit state updates every second during countdown (5→4→3→2→1)
   - **Location**: `lib/features/emergency/bloc/emergency_bloc.dart`
   - **Result**: Users now see live countdown updates: "SOS will be triggered in 5 seconds", "4 seconds", etc.

2. **URL Launcher Errors (SMS/Email/Call)**
   - **Issue**: Android emulator showed "component name is null" errors when trying to send SMS/Email/Call
   - **Root Cause**: Using `canLaunchUrl()` before `launchUrl()` was failing on emulator without apps configured
   - **Fix**: Removed `canLaunchUrl()` checks and call `launchUrl()` directly with proper try-catch error handling
   - **Location**: `lib/features/emergency/services/emergency_service.dart`
   - **Changes**:
     - Simplified SMS launch to single try-catch block
     - Phone call fallback if SMS fails
     - Email launch with proper URI encoding
     - Better error logging for debugging
   - **Result**: SOS notifications now launch properly (will open SMS/Phone/Email apps on real devices)

3. **Dashboard Auto-Refresh Issues**
   - **Issue 1**: Points display didn't update automatically after completing activities
   - **Issue 2**: Recent activities section didn't refresh after completing new activities
   - **Root Cause**: Using `FutureBuilder` with one-time data fetch instead of live streams
   - **Fix**: 
     - Replaced `FutureBuilder` with `StreamBuilder` for points display (listens to profile changes)
     - Created `_getRecentActivitiesStream()` method using `snapshots()` instead of `get()`
     - Replaced `FutureBuilder` with `StreamBuilder` for recent activities
   - **Location**: `lib/features/home/screens/home_screen.dart`
   - **Result**: 
     - ✅ Points update in real-time when earned
     - ✅ Recent activities appear immediately after completion
     - ✅ No manual refresh needed
     - ✅ Dashboard stays in sync with user actions

### Technical Implementation Details:

**Countdown Fix:**
```dart
// Before: Single 5-second wait
await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 5));

// After: Update UI every second
for (int i = 5; i > 0; i--) {
  emit(EmergencyLoaded(contacts: state.contacts, isSOSActive: true, remainingSeconds: i));
  await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 1));
}
```

**Real-time Updates Fix:**
```dart
// Before: One-time fetch
FutureBuilder<DocumentSnapshot>(
  future: FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('profiles').doc(uid).get(),
  ...
)

// After: Live stream
StreamBuilder<DocumentSnapshot>(
  stream: FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('profiles').doc(uid).snapshots(),
  ...
)
```

All dashboard features now work seamlessly with real-time updates!

## Points Synchronization & Medication Reminders (Latest - October 29, 2025) ✅

Both requested features have been implemented:

### ✅ Completed Features:

1. **Points Synchronization Across Dashboard & Activities**
   - **Issue**: Points in the Activities section weren't updating in real-time after completing activities or reading articles
   - **Root Cause**: Activities screen used `FutureBuilder` with manual fetch that only ran on initialization
   - **Fix**: Replaced `FutureBuilder` with `StreamBuilder` listening to live profile changes
   - **Location**: `lib/features/activities/screens/activities_screen.dart`
   - **Changes**:
     - Removed manual `_fetchTotalPoints()` method
     - Added `StreamBuilder` listening to `profiles/{uid}.snapshots()`
     - Points now update instantly when profile's `totalPoints` field changes
   - **Result**: 
     - ✅ Points update in real-time in Activities section
     - ✅ Dashboard and Activities stay synchronized
     - ✅ No manual refresh needed
     - ✅ User sees points increase immediately after earning them

2. **Medication Reminder Box on Dashboard**
   - **Feature**: Conditional medication reminder section that only appears when user has added medications
   - **Implementation**: 
     - Created `_buildMedicationReminder()` widget using `StreamBuilder`
     - Listens to `medications/{uid}/userMedications.snapshots()`
     - Returns `SizedBox.shrink()` when no medications exist (invisible)
     - Shows reminder card when medications are present
   - **Location**: `lib/features/home/screens/home_screen.dart`
   - **Design Features**:
     - Teal-themed card with medication icon
     - Shows count: "You have X medication(s) to take today"
     - "View Medications" button navigating to `/health/medications`
     - Positioned between Recent Activities and Games sections
   - **Result**:
     - ✅ Only visible when user has medications
     - ✅ Automatically appears/disappears based on medication list
     - ✅ Provides quick access to medication management
     - ✅ Seamless integration with dashboard design

### Technical Implementation:

**Points Sync Fix:**
```dart
// Before: Manual fetch on init
int? _totalPoints;
Future<void> _fetchTotalPoints() async {
  final points = await activityService.getTotalPoints();
  setState(() { _totalPoints = points; });
}

// After: Live stream
StreamBuilder<DocumentSnapshot>(
  stream: FirebaseFirestore.instance
      .collection('profiles')
      .doc(FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser?.uid)
      .snapshots(),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    int points = snapshot.data?.data()?['totalPoints'] ?? 0;
    return Text('$points');
  },
)
```

**Medication Reminder:**
```dart
StreamBuilder<QuerySnapshot>(
  stream: FirebaseFirestore.instance
      .collection('medications')
      .doc(userId)
      .collection('userMedications')
      .snapshots(),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    // Hide if no medications
    if (!snapshot.hasData || snapshot.data!.docs.isEmpty) {
      return const SizedBox.shrink();
    }
    // Show reminder card
    return MedicationReminderCard(...);
  },
)
```

All features now work with real-time synchronization and conditional visibility!

## Admin Login Redirect Fix (Latest - October 29, 2025) ✅

Fixed the admin login redirect issue:

### ✅ Fixed Issue:

**Admin Login Redirect to User Dashboard**
- **Problem**: After admin login, the system would redirect admins to the normal user dashboard (`/home`) instead of the admin dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`)
- **Root Cause**: 
  - When admin logs in via Firebase Auth, the `AuthNotifier` detects authentication
  - The router's redirect logic triggers and sees an authenticated user on an auth page
  - It automatically redirects to `/home` without checking if the user is an admin
  - This happens before the navigation to `/admin/dashboard` completes
- **Solution**: Implemented persistent admin session tracking using SharedPreferences
- **Locations**: 
  - `lib/features/admin/services/admin_service.dart`
  - `lib/config/router.dart`
  - `lib/features/profile/screens/profile_screen.dart`
  - `lib/features/admin/screens/admin_login_screen.dart`

### Implementation Details:

**1. Admin Session Tracking (AdminService)**
```dart
// Set admin flag on successful login
final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
await prefs.setBool('isAdmin', true);

// Check if current session is admin
static Future<bool> isAdminSession() async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  return prefs.getBool('isAdmin') ?? false;
}

// Clear admin flag on logout
static Future<void> clearAdminSession() async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.remove('isAdmin');
}
```

**2. Router Redirect Logic Update**
```dart
redirect: (context, state) async {
  // Check if user is admin
  final isAdmin = await AdminService.isAdminSession();
  
  // If authenticated and on auth page, redirect based on role
  if (isAuthenticated && isAuthRoute) {
    return isAdmin ? '/admin/dashboard' : '/home';
  }
  
  // If on splash screen and authenticated
  if (isSplashRoute && isAuthenticated) {
    return isAdmin ? '/admin/dashboard' : '/home';
  }
  ...
}
```

**3. Logout Cleanup**
- Added `AdminService.clearAdminSession()` call in profile logout handler
- Ensures admin flag is removed when user logs out
- Prevents incorrect redirects in subsequent sessions

### Result:
- ✅ Admins now properly navigate to `/admin/dashboard` after login
- ✅ Regular users continue to navigate to `/home`
- ✅ Admin status persists across app restarts
- ✅ Admin flag properly cleared on logout
- ✅ No conflicts with normal authentication flow

The admin portal is now fully functional with correct routing!

## ✅ Admin Login Router Fix (October 29, 2025)

**Issue**: After admin login, users were being redirected to the normal user dashboard instead of the admin dashboard.

**Root Cause**: 
- The router redirect logic was not properly handling admin routes after authentication
- Admin session flag was set, but the navigation wasn't triggering the correct redirect flow
- The redirect logic needed better separation between admin and regular user flows

**Fix Applied**:

1. **Updated Router Redirect Logic** (`lib/config/router.dart`):
   - Restructured redirect logic for better clarity and admin handling
   - Added explicit check: if admin user tries to access regular user routes, redirect to `/admin/dashboard`
   - Admin routes now properly bypass regular auth flow
   - Splash screen correctly redirects admins to `/admin/dashboard` and regular users to `/home`

2. **Updated Admin Login Screen** (`lib/features/admin/screens/admin_login_screen.dart`):
   - Changed from `context.pushReplacement()` to `context.go()` for proper redirect triggering
   - Allows router to evaluate the admin session and apply correct redirect logic

3. **Updated Admin Dashboard** (`lib/features/admin/screens/admin_dashboard_screen.dart`):
   - Added `AdminService.clearAdminSession()` call on logout
   - Ensures admin flag is properly cleared when logging out

**Testing**:
1. ✅ Admin login now correctly redirects to `/admin/dashboard`
2. ✅ Admin users cannot access regular user routes
3. ✅ Regular users cannot access admin routes
4. ✅ Logout properly clears admin session
5. ✅ Splash screen redirects correctly based on user role

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/config/router.dart` - Improved redirect logic
- `lib/features/admin/screens/admin_login_screen.dart` - Fixed navigation method
- `lib/features/admin/screens/admin_dashboard_screen.dart` - Added session cleanup

**The admin routing system is now fully functional and secure!** ✅

## ✅ Admin Dashboard Enhancement - Show All Users (October 29, 2025)

**User Request**: Change "Assigned Users" to "All Users" and make each user clickable so admin can check their health metrics, add medications, etc.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Updated AdminService** (`lib/features/admin/services/admin_service.dart`):
   - Added `getAllUsers()` method to fetch all users from the `profiles` collection
   - Added `getAllSOSEventsFromAllUsers()` method to fetch SOS events from all users in the system
   - These methods replace the previous functionality that only showed assigned users

2. **Updated Admin Dashboard Screen** (`lib/features/admin/screens/admin_dashboard_screen.dart`):
   - Changed from `_assignedUsers` to `_allUsers` to store all users in the system
   - Updated `_loadData()` to call `getAllUsers()` and `getAllSOSEventsFromAllUsers()`
   - Renamed `_buildAssignedUsersSection()` to `_buildAllUsersSection()`
   - Updated stats card to show "Total Users" instead of "Assigned Users"
   - Made all user cards fully clickable - clicking a user navigates to their detail page
   - Enhanced SOS events to display user names and timestamps with "time ago" formatting
   - Removed individual health/medication action buttons in favor of full card tap
   - Added `_getTimeAgo()` helper method for human-readable timestamps

**New Features**:

✅ **All Users Display**:
- Admin dashboard now shows ALL users in the system (not just assigned users)
- Users are sorted alphabetically by display name
- Clean card layout with avatar, name, and email

✅ **Clickable User Cards**:
- Each user card is fully clickable
- Clicking navigates to `/admin/user/{userId}` where admin can:
  - View health metrics
  - View activity history
  - Add/edit/delete medications
  - View SOS events

✅ **Enhanced SOS Events**:
- SOS events now display the user name who triggered the alert
- Shows human-readable "time ago" format (e.g., "2 hours ago", "3 days ago")
- Clicking an SOS event navigates to the user's detail page

✅ **Better Statistics**:
- "Total Users" count shows all registered users
- "SOS Alerts" count shows all SOS events from all users

**User Experience**:
- Clean, modern interface with consistent styling
- Single tap to access complete user management
- Better overview of all users in the system
- Easy access to user health data and management tools

**The admin dashboard now provides complete oversight of all users in the system!** ✅
